          In April 2022, FIFA announced the prizes for all participating
          nations. Each qualified team received $1.5 million before the
          competition to cover preparation costs with each team receiving at
          least $9 million in prize money. This edition's total prize pool was
          $440 million, $40 million greater than the prize pool of the previous
          tournament.[35]

    <p>
      At an estimated cost of over $220 billion,[52] it is the most expensive
      World Cup ever held to date; this figure is disputed by Qatari officials,
      including organising CEO Nasser Al Khater, who said the true cost was $8
      billion, and other figures related to overall infrastructure development
      since the World Cup was awarded to Qatar in 2010.

    In 2022, which witnessed the World Cup in Qatar, revenues amounted to $5.769
    billion, and the largest share of revenues came from the proceeds of selling
    television broadcasting rights.
