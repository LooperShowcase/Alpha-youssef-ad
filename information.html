      Match ball Main article: Adidas Al Rihla The adidas Al Rihla The official
      match ball, "Al Rihla", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly
      inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In
      Arabic, the word Al-Rihla (الْرِّحْلَة ar-riḥla) means "the journey". The
      ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the
      first-ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As
      "the game is getting faster" and "speeds up", the Adidas ball has internal
      electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated
      500 times per second[283] and it has to be charged before each game.[284]
      Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and Qatar
      Airways on a SpaceX falcon 9 suborbital mission for promoting the World
      Cup.[285] The match ball for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Final was announced
      on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the Adidas Al
      Hilm (Arabic: الحلم, romanized: al-ḥulm, lit. 'the dream', a reference to
      "every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup").[286] Whilst the
      technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from
      the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games,
      with a Gold Metallic, maroon, Collegiate Burgundy, and red design,[287] a
      reference to the national colors of host nation Qatar and the golden
      colors shared by the Final's venue and the FIFA World Cup Trophy.[288]
