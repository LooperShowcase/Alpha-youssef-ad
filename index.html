        The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the world
        championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took
        place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country
        was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be
        held in the Arab world and Muslim world, and the second held entirely in
        Asia after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.[A]

        Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the
        title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra
        time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well
        as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament
        since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score
        a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and
        won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the
        tournament. Argentine captain Lionel Messi was voted the tournament's
        best player, winning the Golden Ball. The tournament has been considered
        exceptionally poetic as the capstone of his career, for some
        commentators fulfilling a previously unmet criterion to be regarded the
        greatest player of all time.[4] Teammates Emiliano Martínez and Enzo
        Fernández won the Golden Glove, awarded to the tournament's best
        goalkeeper; and the Young Player Award, awarded to the tournament's best
        young player, respectively. With 172 goals, the tournament set a record
        for the highest number of goals scored in the 32-team format, with every
        participating team scoring at least one goal.
